In parsing grammars, sometimes rules need to be modified to support predictive
parsing. This involves making rules right recursive when they are left
recursive, and defining 'first' sets for rules - the possible set of terminal
symbols that are the first appearing terminal symbols for any evaluation of
that rule.

This file does not attempt to rewrite the entire grammar, it is intended to be
used a supplement to the official language spec. Only those rules which are
affected by predictive parsing needs are rewritten here, and not always in their
entirety.

The rules below appear in the same order they are referenced in the language
specification.

===== First Sets =====
* The items in the sets here are the first appearing terminals for all possible
* evaluations of the rule on the left.
procedure_declaration => {procedure}
variable_declaration => {variable}
type_declaration => {type}

===== Right Recursive Rules =====
