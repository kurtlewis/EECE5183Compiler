# EECE5183 Compiler, "kjlc"
This is a compiler I'm building for my EECE5183 course at the University of
Cincinnati. Our task is to build a simple one-pass compiler that can compile
the language defined at [`docs/language-spec.pdf'](docs/language-spec.pdf).

I have named my compiler `kjlc`.

## Instructions for use
Compile the compiler using `make`. Run the executable `out/kjlc`. I will later
add a help page to the compiler.
